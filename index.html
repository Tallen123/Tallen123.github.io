                i'm Currently working as a IT instructor trainee at <a id="Work_site" style="color: black;" href="https://flipped.ai">Gaius networks</a> Whilst in this role I have learned everything needed to be a full stack developer. With this knowledge
                I create resources that are then used to create course content, which is then put on Flipped.ai for employers to find a candidate.

            <h2>Education / Self Taught Skills</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Python</h3>

            <p>I am Currently learning python and enjoying it i have used Tkinter to allow me to make a few simple widgets so far and have recently been useing python (Flask) to run web applications</p>

            <br>
            <h3>C#</h3>

            <p>within the last year i have made various programs Console applications, software and Services.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>

            <p>Within the last year i have developed my abbilites using JavaScript. This has incuded adding extra functionality to websites and somtimes standalone using Node. I have previously used C# but have found this programming language more intuitive
                to use</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Css</h3>

            <p>I find Css interesting due to its ability to change how a website looks sometimes its very minimal but others its drastic for example something as simple as changing site background or something as complex as site wide Css that changes absolutely
                everything
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>HTML5</h3>

            <p>I have made 20+ websites so far. There are some that have greater simplicity(like this one) but i have also undertaken many others with far greater complexity. I am always amazed by how much can be done with HTML when used with JS and CSS
                as this is something i find real enjoyment in </p>

            <br>
        </div>

        <div id="About_me_page" hidden>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                <script>
                    // More to be added soon
                </script>
                I am a friendly, trustworthy and well-presented individual who is looking to continue building my work experience within the programming industry.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                throughout my life I have always been self taught in a number of applications and systems such as Website development and software development and i have also had the opportunity to use this experiance whithin a practical work setting whilst employed
                where i have used my skills in web development aswell as learn python development with Gaius networks.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                An area of particular enjoyment for me is website development as I am very interested in the amount of programing needed and this is a area i would be keen to be wokring on
            </p>

        <div id="ProjectsPage" hidden>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Discord Bot</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This is a social media bot that is in a Discord Server and responds to people commands with the respective response this program has been re-worked 3 times to add more functionality while keeping the amount of code low.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Time and Weather</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This is a basic Python program but its also my first. Time and Weather uses 2 APIs to get the time and then the Weather after this it processes that information as the weather was in kelvin originally before getting converted to celsius but
                the biggest challenge was drawing that information to the screen and updating it every second. But during the development process i had a lot of fun as well as i learnt a lot about this language that ive never used before. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>HUB</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This is a program that manages other programs. HUB takes the a supported file (.exe, .py, .js) and runs it on startup if wanted, HUB also catches the console output of said program this can be seen within the program itself.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Linked</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This was a application that allowed the user to connect to 4 social media platforms at the same time but as my development focus has changed to web development i am considering how i can make this a possibility on the web.</p>
            <br>

            <h3><a id="Nihongo" style="color: black;" href="https://tallen.pythonanywhere.com/">Nihongo.net</a></h3>
            <script>
                var Nihongo = document.getElementById("Nihongo");
                Nihongo.onmouseenter = function() {

                    this.style.color = "black";
                }
            </script>
            <br>
            <p>Nihongo.net is a project of mine and a few friends where we aim to teach people Japanese aswell as Japanese Culture. This project Uses HTML, CSS, JS as-well as pyton(Flask)(passion project). <br> This is also the biggest project ive worked
                on.

        <div id="HobbiesPage" hidden>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <br><br>
            <h3>languages</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I really enjoy learning new things and languages are no exemption as i can speak Japanese to a moderate level and a few others at an basic level as i seam to just pick up random words from random languages sometimes but due to this my vocabulary
                in Japanese is really vast not due to learning or studying but just by accident. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>As you can already tell i really enjoy Programming but it wasn't a career path i thought of when i first started learning it i just learnt how to programme because it look interesting and in was not disappointed as i have 100% enjoyed the
                time from learning to using the 5 programming languages i can now use. whenever i have an idea i open visual studio code and sometimes headbutt a wall for hours but its the eventual success that i really love about it. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I also enjoying playing video game's on my pc whether that be with friend's or alone its one of my favorite past time activity when i am not programming or talking to people online. i tried my hand at game development a while ago with Unity
                and had some fun with that.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <br>
            <p>whether i am programming, playing a game or just chatting with friends i always have some music on in the background but interestingly enough i don't listen to English music its mainly Japanese music due to the different tone this type of
                music offers the difference in my eyes at least is massive. </p>
