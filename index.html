            i'm Currently working as a IT instructor trainee at <a id="link" style="color: #6F2232;" href="https://gaiusnetworks.com/">GAIUS Networks INC</a> where i learn the basics of web design and much more
            then i make material that is then turned into a video for people to learn said subject from.
              Personally i really enjoy leaning more about tech and programming just being able to understand how things work and carry out specific tasks is something i love.

                            and learning new things about it as when making this site i learnt how to use <b>CSS</b>

                            I have use <b>JavaScript</b> many times to programme functionality into the site's i have made and have found it to be very versatile 
                            and better Than C# which was the First Programming language i learnt and that was when i found out i really enjoy coding since then i have 
                            been coding everyday to get better at it as-well as learn new things. I also remade the discord bot mentioned in the C# section in JavaScript
                            which i enjoyed as it was different then what i had use JavaScript for in the past which posed it's own challenges.
