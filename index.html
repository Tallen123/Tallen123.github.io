                This was a discord bot, "Was" because i had to shut it down after 6 months of use but regardless
                "Hatsumi"
                which was a name given to this discord bot by a member of the community it managed and supported.
                This bot had many features just to name a few, it could play music,
                scan posts for anything that broke the community rules and then report said user to the admin team, it
                could also post
                itself at the request of community members.

            <p>
                This piece of software was something I created to help keep track of earnings and hours spent when I was
                working self-employed/freelance originally it would take in user-given data and save it to a JSON file
                this has recently been
                updated to be a self-contained SQL database. Also recently completely updated its UI, Once this software
                is finished it will
                get an open-source license as I hope people can take this and make it their own.

            <p>
                I started this project when I ran linux on my PC as i noticed a lack of mod support for games
                of the platform and as someone who enjoys gaming as well as modding said games i decided id make my own
                which will
                be open source once it's in a better place as it's still in the early phases of development, i
                want this software
                to be able to manage many games at once with the help of mulit threading.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>And many more.. but im under a NDA sooo.</h3>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <br><br>
            <h3>languages</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning new things and languages are no exception as I can speak Japanese and a few other languages
                but only at a very basic level due to me not learning them. I pick up words from different languages
                every so often randomly. This is how I started with Japanese I picked up a few words here and there so I i figured
                id give it a shot and learn it properly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now this is something I started doing randomly one day after meeting someone online who was making a game for a gamejam
                I watched him create this game, Once it was finished I figured id give it a shot myself and after about 6 months of 
                headbutting a wall I finally got a very basic game working just a simple platformer however the feeling of it all 
                finally coming together and working was very much worth it. 
                I managed to turn a simple hobby into something I could do as a job which excited me as I could do something I enjoy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also play video games in my free time on my own or with friend's this is something i do when im not developing a
                proof of concept or working on any of my Projects or talking to people online, I did try my hand at game development a while ago with unity and unreal
                engine and i had quite a lot of fun but realised it's not for me after a few weeks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                whether i am programming, playing a game or just chatting with friends i always have some music on in the
                background but I personally listen to music in Japanese as well as english sometimes mainly Japanese due to the 
                languages richness when compared to english. i've also tried making my own music before and while it was enjoyable
                i couldnt quite get the hang of it.
