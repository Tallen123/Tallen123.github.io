    <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size: xx-large;">japanese Learning program (no formal name as of now)</h3>
    <p style=" text-align:center; font-size: x-large; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
        this program teaches japanese to people as i found the leaning resources online to 
        but very unorganized and scattered due to this it makes learning the language difficult. This is where my program comes in it will allow users to just simply learn nothing else
        no fancy methods just all the relevant information in bite size lessons and tests.

     <h3 style="text-align:center; font-size: xx-large;"></h3style>Discord bot (nicknamed "Hatsumi" by many of the bots users)</h3>
    <p style=" text-align:center; font-size: x-large; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
        i have also made a discord (social media platform built up of servers/Groups) bot and this bot is tied to a account which is inactive until someone executes a relevant command which will trigger
        the predetermined response which is sometimes as simple as a reply to the message which triggered the function to run or it can be as complex as connecting to a voice chat and playing music for all to hear or sending an
        image when prompted this has many many more functions and capped out at around 5000+ lines of code. This is also locally hosted which caused a few issues at first as i had to figure out to make it launch on OS start up which
        is something ive never done before it also required a system tray icon and so it could be running in the background and not get in the way of daily use of my computer. This was originally hosted using Azure but changed to local 
        host as azure is not free and due to this being made in C#/C-sharp and not JavaScript i couldn't use any free hosting solutions.

    <p style=" text-align:center; font-size: x-large; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">
        I also have made a application which is able to give users the ability to view multiple social media platforms at the same time with no need for an internet browser
        it does it all for you, as of today you can sign into 5 different platforms and view them at the same time i plan to improve this in the future.
