    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>languages</h2>
        <p>I really enjoy learning new things and languages are no exemption as i can speak Japanese to a moderate level and
           a few others at an basic level as i seam to just pick up random words from random languages sometimes but due to this
           my vocab in Japanese is really vast not due to learning or studying but just by accident.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
           As you can already tell i really enjoy Programming but it wasn't a career path i thought of when i first started learning it
           i just learnt how to programme because it look interesting and in was not disappointed as i have 100% enjoyed the time from learning to using the
           5 programming languages i can now use. whenever i have an idea i open visual studio code and sometimes headbutt a wall for hours
           but its the eventual success that i really love about it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            I also enjoying playing video game's on my pc whether that be with friend's or alone its one of my favorite past time activity
            when i am not programming or talking to people online. i tried my hand at game development a while ago with Unity and had some fun with that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
            whether i am programming, playing a game or just chatting with friends i always have some music on in the background but interestingly enough i 
            don't listen to English music its mainly Japanese music due to the different tone this type of music offers the difference in my eyes at least is massive.
